`osprey` is an R package for community contributed analysis functions to
create TLGs (tables, listing and graphs) for the analysis of clinical
trials data. These functions can be used stand alone to generate static
analysis, but are also called by the
[teal.osprey](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.osprey/)
package which provides modules to be used inside
[`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/) applications.

The package provides:

- waterfall plots
  ([`g_waterfall`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/osprey/latest-tag/reference/g_waterfall.html))
- swim lane plots
  ([`g_swimlane`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/osprey/latest-tag/reference/g_swimlane.html))
- spider plots
  ([`g_spiderplot`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/osprey/latest-tag/reference/g_spiderplot.html))
- butterfly plots
  ([`g_butterfly`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/osprey/latest-tag/reference/g_butterfly.html))
- and many more
